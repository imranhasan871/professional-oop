Practice 02: Find Min & Max Salary


You will develop a console application to read data from the salarysheet.csv file. This file contains employee name and salary amount in separate columns, as shown below:

Dolon	45000
Rafi	34000
Hasan	56000
Salma	45000

Your program should display min and max salary in the following format:

Max: Hasan	56000
Min: Rafi	34000

Note: Please download the salarysheet.csv file to your local computer first.

Create a method ReadDataFromCSVFile(string fileName)
FindMaxSalaryWithEmployeeName(salaryList)
Show Maximum salary
FindMinSalaryWithEmployeeName(salaryList)
Show Minimum salary
