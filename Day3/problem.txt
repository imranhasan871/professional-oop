Practice 03: Generate a voucher

You will develop a console application to read data from the groceryitems.csv file. This file contains item ID, quantity, and unit price in separate columns, as shown below:

item-937    12    230.5
item-432    3     120.0
item-431    1     1230.0
item-098    5     12.5
item-133    8     30.0


Your program should display a voucher in the following format. The voucher will include item ID, quantity, unit price, and total price for each item. Additionally, it will calculate and display the grand total, 5% VAT, and the net total. See the expected output format below. You will display the output on the console and also save it to a text file.

Item id		Qty	unit price	total
item-937	12	230.5		2766.0
item-432	3	120.0		360.0
item-431	1	1230.0		1230.0
item-098	5	12.5		62.5
item-133	8	30.0		240.0

Total		29	Grand total 	4,658.5
VAT (5%)	232.925
Net total	4425.575	


Please ensure that your program does not generate a voucher if there are any duplicate item IDs. In such cases, display an appropriate message to the user indicating which item IDs are duplicated so they can correct the issue.

Note: Please download the groceryitems.csv file to your local computer first.
