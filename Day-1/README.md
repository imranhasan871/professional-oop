## 1. Introduction to OOP

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code to manipulate that data. OOP aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc. in programming.

## 2. Key Concepts

### Classes and Objects

- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure).
- **Object**: An instance of a class.

### Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behavior (methods) from an existing class.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.

## 3. Setting Up Your Environment

Instructions on setting up your programming environment.

## 4. Writing Your First Class

A step-by-step guide to writing your first class in OOP.

## 5. Practical Examples

Examples to demonstrate the concepts learned.
